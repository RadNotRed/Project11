# Encode / Decode Secret Messages

Create a two class project that will encode and decode secret messages. You will take the knowledge you learned about Ceaser ciphers and ask the user for the message to either encode or decode and the phase shift they would like to use. After gathering the information, the boss class will pass it to the worker class to do the work.
## Main clas will:

    Ask if they wish to encode or decode
    Ask for the message to process
    Ask for the phase shift to be used
    Pass over to the worker class all of the above information
    Print out the message after it was prosessed.

## Worker class will:
```
Have a minimum of 5 methods
  1. Constructor method: instiated all global variables
  2. Collect information method: used to collect the nesscary data, and set the data to the correct variables
  3. Encode Message Method: used to put the message into secret format
  4. Decode Message Method: used to take the mesage out of secret format
  5. toString Method:  used to pass back the desired output
```
